    This class is created as an intermediate object in the process of mapping of the shopping carts from the server.
    It's used to map the array of items with their quantity. That array is mapped from the shopping cart mapping function, under the property named "products".
    Then, the shopping cart creates the data of the dictionary with instances of this model.
